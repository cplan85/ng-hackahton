# Angular Hackathon Starter <a href="https://angular.io/" target="blank"><img src="https://angular.io/assets/images/logos/angular/angular.svg" height="28px" alt="Angular Logo"/></a>

This project contains boilerplate for creating web apps using [Angular](https://angular.io), a web framework for building efficient and scalable mobile and desktop applications.

It is mostly built to be used as a starting point in hackathons and implements common authentication functionality such as login, sign up, form validation, JWT authentication, state storage and more. It also has common UI elements such as navigation bar, footer, landing page, etc.

You can also look at my [Nest Hackathon Starter](https://github.com/ahmetuysal/nest-hackathon-starter) template that shares the same contract with this web app.
